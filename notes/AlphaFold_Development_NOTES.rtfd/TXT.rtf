At present model has l, l_BP, Kd_BP, C_init; and just C-G pairs.\
 \
If we collect Kd data on a bunch of sequences with the MS2 hairpin, how well would they constrain the model?\
\
Since we only have single strands, can\'92t get C_init separately from others.\
Just assume l, l_BP at my defaults (0.5, 0.2).\
\
Let\'92s make a bunch of test sequences.\
\'95\'a0First three are \'91controls\'92 that should fold MS2 hairpin nicely.\
\'95\'a0Next few have G/C segments in flanking regions\
\'95\'a010th one (\'91sequence 9\'92 in python) is all C\'92s and G\'92s and definitely forms alternative hairpins\
\
test_sequences = [ MS2_hairpin,\
                  'CCCGCGGCC'+MS2_hairpin+'GGCCGCGGG',\
                   MS2_hairpin+'AAAAAAAAAAAAA',\
                  'AAACGAACGACCA'+MS2_hairpin+'AAACAAAGAAAA',\
                  'GGGC'+MS2_hairpin,\
                  MS2_hairpin+'GGGC',\
                 'AAACCAGCGACGAGGACGACGAGCGACGACGACGAGCGACGACAAACC'+MS2_hairpin,\
                 'AAACCAGCGACGAGGACGACGAAACC'+MS2_hairpin+'CAAGAGGAAAAACCCAAAAAAGCAAC',\
                 'AAAAGAGAGAAACAAAGACAGACAAA'+MS2_hairpin+'AAAAAGAAACAACCAAAGAAAGAAAG',\
                 'CCGCGCCGCGCGCGCGGGCGCGGCGC'+MS2_hairpin+'CGCGCGGCGCGGCGCGCGCGCGGGGG'\
                 ]\

OK, here\'92s bpp(MS2) for all sequences;\

Imagine \'91real\'92 Kd_BP was 2e-4 M. Would these sequences be enough to \'91solve\'92 for that parameter?\
\
Yea, almost \'96\'a0pretty flat (magenta curve is TOTAL LOSS FUNCTION, offset by 10) \'96\'a0note that 
\f1\b colors are different
\f0\b0  from above.\

\cf4 Added jitter of 1kT to bpp_rel values\'85 looks like optimum estimated Kd_BP of 1e-5 in this case \'97 pretty far off 2e-4. \
Still, the most \'91discriminating\'92 sequence is \'91seq 9\'92, the 10th sequence, which is super G-C rich:\

\
That useful 10th sequence has a bop plot that has a lot of competitors and suppresses bpp(MS2) to ~1%.\
